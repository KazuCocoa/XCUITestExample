# XCUITestExample

This example is just a sample for demo in STAR.
The sample application is cloned from sample of Appium.([here](https://github.com/appium/sample-code/tree/master/sample-code/apps/TestApp) is URL for it.)


# What I do
1. Add `XCUITest` target via `Editor` exist on status bar.
2. Update architecture for  64 bit.
3. Add schema to run `XCUITest`.
4. Add some test cases on `TestAppUITests` with Swift.
